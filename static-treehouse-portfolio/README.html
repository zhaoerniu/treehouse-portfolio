<p>===============</p>

<p>Wordpress Theme for Zac to use on his Treehouse teaching projects.</p>

<p>Authored by @thinmatt</p>

<p>Site was initially built using Workspaces, but that became a bit too cumbersome. I switched over to Sublime Text 3 so I could use Sass. I eventually brought in Hammer for Mac to handle the build out.</p>

<p>The site is built on top of a Foundation Framework custom download.</p>
